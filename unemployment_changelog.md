# Changelog

All notable changes to the Unemployment Analysis project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial project structure with Jupyter notebook
- Data loading from Kaggle Unemployment in India dataset
- Data cleaning and standardization pipeline
- COVID-19 impact analysis (March-August 2020 comparison)
- Seasonal trend analysis (monthly and quarterly patterns)
- State-wise unemployment statistics
- Multi-dimensional visualization suite (6 plots)
- README with project overview

### Known Issues
- 28 rows with missing values removed during cleaning (0.04% of dataset)
- Recovery period (Sep-Dec 2020) shows NaN values in summary statistics
- Post-vaccine period (Jan 2021+) shows NaN values - data may be incomplete
- No confidence intervals or statistical significance testing performed

## [1.0.0] - 2024-01-XX

### Features
- **Data Exploration**: Load and describe 768 unemployment records across Indian states
- **Date Range**: May 2019 - June 2020 (13 months of data)
- **Metrics Tracked**:
  - Unemployment rate (%)
  - Employed population
  - Labour participation rate (%)
  - Geographic area (Rural/Urban)
  
### Analysis Capabilities
- **COVID-19 Impact**: 8.26% increase in unemployment during severe phase
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Q2 shows highest unemployment (15.58%), Q3 lowest (9.24%)
- **Regional Insights**: Top states - Tripura (28.35%), Haryana (26.28%), Jharkhand (20.59%)
- **Distribution**: Mean unemployment 11.79%, Median 8.35%

### Visualizations
1. Unemployment trend over time with COVID-19 markers
2. COVID-19 impact comparison across phases
3. Monthly seasonality patterns with confidence bands
4. Quarterly average rates
5. Unemployment rate distribution histogram
6. Year-over-year comparison (2019 vs 2020)

### Data Source
- **Dataset**: Unemployment in India (Kaggle)
- **Version**: 5 (as of project initialization)
- **Records**: 768 total, 740 after cleaning
- **Columns**: 7 (Region, Date, Frequency, Unemployment Rate, Employed, Labour Participation Rate, Area)

## Data Quality Notes

### Version 1.0.0
- **Completeness**: 96.4% (740/768 valid records)
- **Missing Data Pattern**: Scattered across dataset, likely incomplete data collection periods
- **Date Continuity**: Monthly data from May 2019 to June 2020
- **Geographic Coverage**: 28 states/union territories in India
- **Area Coverage**: Both rural and urban areas represented

### Recommendations
- Investigate specific records with missing values for patterns
- Source additional data for Q3-Q4 2020 and 2021 for complete analysis
- Validate rural/urban unemployment correlation with national statistics

## Future Enhancements

### Planned
- [ ] Statistical significance testing for period comparisons
- [ ] Confidence interval calculations
- [ ] Forecasting model for unemployment trends
- [ ] Interactive dashboard with Plotly/Dash
- [ ] State-specific trend analysis
- [ ] Correlation analysis with other economic indicators

### Potential Improvements
- [ ] Regional clustering analysis
- [ ] Time-series decomposition (trend, seasonal, residual)
- [ ] Outlier detection and anomaly analysis
- [ ] Comparison with international unemployment data
- [ ] Demographic breakdown analysis (if data available)
- [ ] Export analysis results to PDF/HTML reports
