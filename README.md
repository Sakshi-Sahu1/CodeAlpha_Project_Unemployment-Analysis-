# Unemployment Data Analysis Project

A comprehensive Python-based analysis of unemployment trends in India, featuring data visualization, COVID-19 impact assessment, and seasonal pattern analysis.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes unemployment data from India, examining:
- Temporal trends and patterns
- COVID-19 pandemic impact on unemployment rates
- Seasonal variations (monthly and quarterly)
- State/region-wise analysis
- Statistical distributions

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Automated preprocessing and standardization
- **COVID-19 Analysis**: Before/during/after pandemic comparison
- **Seasonal Trends**: Monthly and quarterly unemployment patterns
- **Visualizations**: 6 comprehensive plots saved as high-resolution images
- **Regional Analysis**: State-wise unemployment statistics

## 📋 Requirements

```
pandas>=1.3.0
numpy>=1.21.0
matplotlib>=3.4.0
seaborn>=0.11.0
